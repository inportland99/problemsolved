        <h3>A custom deck of cards for use in the math classroom</h3>
        <p>The cards are a reminder to focus on the infinite ways students can display their gifts in the classroom that go beyond academic knowledge.</p>
        <p>One side has words to inspire you to see various forms of brilliance. The other side allows you to write a personalized note to the student.</p>
        <p>If you love these cards and would like some for your classroom, <a href="mailto:info@drrajshah.com">let me know</a>. If they become popular, I'll start producing them in larger quantities so you can order them from this site.</p>
